            What is a Political Road Show?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
            A political roadshow is a series of coordinated events, typically
            involving travel to multiple locations, aimed at promoting a
            political campaign or cause. These events provide an invaluable
            opportunity to connect with voters, address their concerns, and
            build momentum.
